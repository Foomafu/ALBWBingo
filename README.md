# ALBWBingo

A little Bingo Goal generator I made as a non-programmer with the help of ChatGPT. It asks for a number of objectives, then spits out a randomized selection in the format used by custom game boards on BingoSync.

Designed to be used with the following randomizer preset, or something similar. But I'm not your parent, so do what you want with it.
